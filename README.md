# 👋 Hi there! I'm chaehyun

I'm currently an undergraduate student majoring in **Artificial Intelligence**.  
I’m passionate about **deep learning**, especially in areas like **computer vision**, **YOLO**, and **neural networks**.

I'm continuously working on improving my coding and research skills, and I plan to pursue **graduate studies** after graduation.

## 🔭 Current Interests
- Deep Learning (CNN, GAN, LLM)
- Object Detection (YOLOv5, YOLOv8)
- Natural Language Processing
- Python, PyTorch

## 📘 Ongoing Projects
I'm currently working on:
- Custom object detection using YOLOv5  
- Fine-tuning pre-trained language models  
- Research-based mini-projects and implementations

## 📝 Blog & GitHub
I use this GitHub to share my projects, experiment logs, and ideas.  
I'll be uploading more project code, AI papers I've studied, and personal notes.

Feel free to check out my repositories or contact me!
